module Rackstash
  # This module defines the integration of Rackstash into Sinatra as a Sinatra
  # plugin. When registering this plugin in your Sinatra app, we will setup a
  # Rack middleware to provide a logger to each request handled by Sinatra. You
  # can use this logger the same way you can with the original Rack logger.
  #
  # All messages logged to the logger during the request will be captured in a
  # Buffer and (by default) logged as a single log event after the response was
  # sent.
  #
  # To use the Rackstash integration, you have to register the plugin in your
  # Sinatra application:
  #
  #     require 'rackstash/sinatra'
  #     register Rackstash::Sinatra
  #
  #     # Optionally set the log target. By default, we'll write JSON logs to STDOUT
  #     set :rackstash, "log/#{environment}.log"
  #
  #     get '/' do
  #       logger.info 'Starting request...'
  #       "Hello world!"
  #     end
  #
  # or when using the modular Sinatra application style:
  #
  #     require 'rackstash/sinatra'
  #
  #     class MySinatraApp < Sinatra::Base
  #       register Rackstash::Sinatra
  #
  #       # Logging is enabled by default when inheriting from Sinatra::Application
  #       enable :logging
  #
  #       # Optionally set the log target. By default, we'll write JSON logs to STDOUT
  #       set :rackstash, "log/#{environment}.log"
  #
  #       get '/' do
  #         logger.info 'Starting request...'
  #         "Hello world!"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # Note that in any case, we will only log to Rackstash if both `logging` is
  # enabled and the `rackstash` setting is set to a a value other than `false`.
  #
  # To further configure the Rackstash logger, we add the following
  # configuration settings to the application when you register the
  # `Rackstash::Sinatra` plugin:
  #
  # * `rackstash => Rackstash::Logger, Object, nil` - the logger or log target
  #   of the logging middleware. When setting this to `false`, Rackstash
  #   integration will be disabled and Sinatra's default logging settings will
  #   be used. When setting it to a `Rackstash::Logger` object, we use it
  #   it directly. In all other cases, we assume the given value is a log device
  #   (e.g. an `IO` object or the name of a log file) which can be used to
  #   create a suitable Rackstash adapter with a new `Rackstash::Logger` object
  #   for use by the middleware.
  # * `rackstash_buffering => Symbol, Boolean` - defines the buffering mode of
  #   buffers created by the {Rackstash::Sinatra::Middleware} for each request.
  #   You can set it to `:full` to emit only a single log event per request, to
  #   `:data` to accumulate fields and tags on the request's buffer but to emit
  #   a new log event per logged message, or to `:none` to emit log events for
  #   each message and to clear the buffer afterwards. See the Rackstash
  #   documentation of `Rackstash::Buffer#buffering` for details.
  # * `rackstash_request_fields => Hash<#to_s, => Proc, Object>, Fields::Hash, Proc` -
  #   Additional fields to merge into the emitted log event before processing
  #   the request. If the object itself or any of its hash values is a `Proc`,
  #   it will get called, passing the `Rack::Request` object for the current
  #   request as an argument, and its result is used instead.
  # * `rackstash_request_tags => Array<#to_s, Proc>, Set<#to_s, Proc>, Proc` -
  #   an `Array` specifying default tags for each request. You can either give a
  #   literal `Array` containing Strings or a `Proc` which returns such an
  #   `Array`. If the object itself or any of its values is a `Proc`, it is
  #   called, passing the `Rack::Request` object for the current request as an
  #   argument, and its result is used instead.
  # * `rackstash_response_fields => Hash<#to_s, => Proc, Object>, Fields::Hash, Proc` -
  #   Additional fields to merge into the emitted log event after processing the
  #   request and sending the complete response. If the object itself or any of
  #   its hash values is a `Proc`, it will get called, passing the `Hash` of
  #   response headers of the current response as an argument, and its result is
  #   used instead.
  # * `rackstash_response_tags => Array<#to_s, Proc>, Set<#to_s, Proc>, Proc` -
  #   an `Array` specifying default tags for each returned response. You can
  #   either give a literal `Array` containing Strings or a `Proc` which returns
  #   such an `Array`. If the object itself or any of its values is a `Proc`, it
  #   is called, passing the `Hash` of response headers of the current response
  #   as an argument, and its result is used instead.
  #
  # You can set any of these options using Sinatra's `set` method in the class
  # context, e.g.
  #
  #     set :rackstash, "log/#{environment}.log"
  #     set :rackstash_request_fields, {
  #       'user_agent' => ->(request) { request.user_agent },
  #       'remote_ip' => ->(request) { request.ip },
  #       'server' => Socket.gethostname
  #     }
  #
  # In development mode, it is sometimes desirable to produce logs intended for
  # only human consumption, mostly resembling the default logs of Sinatra. To
  # enable that, you configure the Rackstash logger to output only the messages
  # as soon as they are logged. A suitable configuration can look like this:
  #
  #     logger = Rackstash::Logger.new(STDOUT, level: Rackstash::INFO) do |flow|
  #       flow.encoder Rackstash::Encoder::Message.new(['@timestamp'])
  #     end
  #
  #     set :logging, true
  #     set :rackstash, logger
  #     set :rackstash_buffering, :data
